{"qid": "abc349_a", "orig_input": "There are N people labeled 1 to N, who have played several one-on-one games without draws. Initially, each person started with 0 points. In each game, the winner's score increased by 1 and the loser's score decreased by 1 (scores can become negative). Determine the final score of person N if the final score of person i\\ (1\\leq i\\leq N-1) is A_i. It can be shown that the final score of person N is uniquely determined regardless of the sequence of games.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\r\nA_1 A_2 \\ldots A_{N-1}\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the answer.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 2 \\leq N \\leq 100\n- -100 \\leq A_i \\leq 100\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4\r\n1 -2 -1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\r\n\nHere is one possible sequence of games where the final scores of persons 1, 2, 3 are 1, -2, -1, respectively.\n\n- Initially, persons 1, 2, 3, 4 have 0, 0, 0, 0 points, respectively.\n- Persons 1 and 2 play, and person 1 wins. The players now have 1, -1, 0, 0 point(s).\n- Persons 1 and 4 play, and person 4 wins. The players now have 0, -1, 0, 1 point(s).\n- Persons 1 and 2 play, and person 1 wins. The players now have 1, -2, 0, 1 point(s).\n- Persons 2 and 3 play, and person 2 wins. The players now have 1, -1, -1, 1 point(s).\n- Persons 2 and 4 play, and person 4 wins. The players now have 1, -2, -1, 2 point(s).\n\nIn this case, the final score of person 4 is 2. Other possible sequences of games exist, but the score of person 4 will always be 2 regardless of the progression.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3\r\n0 0\n\nSample Output 2\n\n0\n\nSample Input 3\n\n6\r\n10 20 30 40 50\n\nSample Output 3\n\n-150", "input": "SUMMARY\nCalculate the final score of the last person in a group based on the scores of all other participants after a series of one-on-one games.", "test_cases": [{"input": "4\n1 -2 -1\n", "output": "2\n", "testtype": "stdin"}, {"input": "3\n0 0\n", "output": "0\n", "testtype": "stdin"}, {"input": "6\n10 20 30 40 50\n", "output": "-150\n", "testtype": "stdin"}], "priv_test": "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", "solutions": "# YOUR CODE HERE\n\nN = int(input())\nscores = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal_sum = sum(scores)\nscore_N = -total_sum\n\nprint(score_N)", "task": "livecodebench", "difficulty": "easy", "split": "test", "transformation_type": "plain_summary", "starter": ""}
